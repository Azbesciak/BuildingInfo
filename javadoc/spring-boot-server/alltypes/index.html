<td>
<p>Represents single level of some building structure.
Contract is that it is a container for lower-spaced objects, in this case - {#link Room}
However, it can be also some other location with inherits after {#link Room}.</p>

<a href="../cs.io.building-info.location/-location/index.html">cs.io.buildingInfo.location.Location</a></td>
<td>
<p>Basic interface to represent any locations.
It assumes that every location has a cube (given in meters^3), area (meters^2), heating (KWh) and light.
Also, each location has it's own id. However, its interpretation is dependent on the consumer.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="../cs.io.building-info.location/-location-aggregator/index.html">cs.io.buildingInfo.location.LocationAggregator</a></td>
<td>
<p>Upper level which contains some other locations.
There is no requirement of location type.
All calculations are lazy - calculated only once
for all aggregated location when given is called.</p>

<a href="../cs.io.building-info.location/-location-calculations-controller/index.html">cs.io.buildingInfo.location.LocationCalculationsController</a></td>
<td>
<p>Main controller responsible for giving information about locations.
It require JSON input format, in most cases return single value.
Methods have polimorfic inputs - however, correct json structure is required,
otherwise may be wrongly parsed.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="../cs.io.building-info.location/-location-deserializer/index.html">cs.io.buildingInfo.location.LocationDeserializer</a></td>
<td>
<p>Json Deserializer which parses input to some location, depending on input structure.
It can return {#link Room}, {#link Level} or {#link Building}.
Also, when data is malformed, can throw Jackson's Parse Error/NullPointer when some fields are missing.
When additional parameters are passed, they are not considered.</p>

<tr>
<td>
<a href="../cs.io.building-info.location/-room/index.html">cs.io.buildingInfo.location.Room</a></td>
<td>
<p>Basic implementation of {#link Location}.
Requires each value to be positive, otherwise throws {#link IllegalStateException}.</p>
